- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m RazorLemon (quite obviously my internet name), I'm just a normal person here to upload my stylus/tamper-monkey codes so that I don't have to give the whole code to the person who asks it everytime...
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mostly Typing. Meeting the Typeracer community and that of other typing websites, mainly made me what I am today and inspired me to do these things. Otherwise I'm also interested in playing osu! Just wanted to add this so that it doesn't look too formal...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on getting faster and learning more css to make new themes and designs.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me... If you want to contact me, then as I don't have an official email right now, so you can just go ahead and contact me on discord. This is my username: RazorLemonä¹ˆ#3475
